## Getting Started
- Install dependencies in the root and in `server/`.
- Create a `.env.local` for the frontend if the API is on a different origin.
- Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env` and set required values.

## Development Flow
1. Create a feature branch.
2. Keep changes scoped and add clear descriptions in PRs.
3. If you change UI, include screenshots.

## Code Standards
- TypeScript + React (TSX), 2‑space indentation.
- Keep components small and focused.
- Prefer existing patterns and utilities.

## Reporting Issues
Open an issue with clear repro steps and expected behavior.
